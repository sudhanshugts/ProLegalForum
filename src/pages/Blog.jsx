            How ADR Strengthens the Litigation Framework
          </h2>

          <p className="delay-2">
            Litigation remains the cornerstone of dispute resolution. However,
            increasing caseloads, procedural complexity and extended timelines
            have placed sustained pressure on courts and litigants alike. In
            this context, structured alternative dispute resolution mechanisms
            have assumed growing importance. Alternative Dispute Resolution
            (ADR), including arbitration and mediation, operates within a
            legally recognised framework and functions in coordination with the
            judicial system. Courts routinely support ADR through referrals,
            enforcement of arbitral awards and recognition of mediated
            settlements. A key contribution of ADR lies in procedural
            efficiency. Commercial and contractual disputes that are suited for
            structured resolution can be addressed through arbitration, enabling
            courts to focus on matters requiring formal adjudication. Defined
            timelines, limited hearings and issue-focused proceedings reduce
            procedural delays while maintaining legal rigour. The ability to
            appoint decision-makers with subject-specific expertise further
            enhances the quality and efficiency of outcomes. Importantly, ADR
            does not replace litigation. It complements the judicial process by
            reducing procedural burden and ensuring that disputes are resolved
            in a timely, structured and enforceable manner.

            ADR as a Complement to the Judicial Process
          </h2>

          <p className="delay-2">
            The effectiveness of any dispute resolution system depends not only
            on adjudication, but also on the availability of structured
            mechanisms that support judicial efficiency. As courts continue to
            address complex and high-volume dockets, Alternative Dispute
            Resolution (ADR) has emerged as a critical institutional complement.
            ADR mechanisms such as arbitration and mediation function within a
            legally recognised and court-supported framework. Their role is not
            to displace litigation, but to assist the justice delivery system by
            resolving disputes that are suited for structured, time-bound
            determination. Arbitration, in particular, offers defined procedural
            timelines, focused hearings and neutral decision-making, enabling
            parties to obtain enforceable outcomes without prolonged litigation.
            This procedural discipline reduces strain on courts while preserving
            legal certainty and fairness. Another significant advantage of ADR
            is finality. Arbitral awards and mediated settlements are
            enforceable under law and subject to judicial oversight where
            necessary. Confidential proceedings further protect sensitive
            commercial and institutional interests. Viewed in this context, ADR
            strengthens the dispute resolution ecosystem by allowing courts to
            concentrate on matters requiring authoritative adjudication, while
            ensuring that other disputes are resolved efficiently and with
            procedural integrity.

            Why ADR Matters in Modern Dispute Resolution
          </h2>

          <p className="delay-2">
            As litigation becomes increasingly complex and time-intensive,
            structured ADR mechanisms play an essential supporting role in the
            justice system. Arbitration and mediation operate within a legally
            recognised framework and are consistently supported by courts
            through referrals and enforcement. By offering defined timelines,
            focused proceedings and enforceable outcomes, ADR enables efficient
            resolution of commercial and institutional disputes. Rather than
            replacing litigation, ADR complements it—reducing procedural burden,
            preserving confidentiality and ensuring that disputes are resolved
            in a disciplined and legally sound manner.

            Judicial Trends and the Expanding Role of Section 89 CPC
          </h2>

          <p className="delay-2">
            The Indian judiciary has consistently emphasised the need for
            structured alternative dispute resolution mechanisms to support the
            effective functioning of the justice delivery system. Among the most
            significant legislative tools in this regard is Section 89 of the
            Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, which empowers courts to encourage
            settlement of disputes through recognised alternative processes.
            Over time, judicial interpretation of Section 89 has clarified that
            alternative dispute resolution is not peripheral to the justice
            system, but an integral component of it. Courts have repeatedly
            acknowledged that litigation, while essential, cannot be the sole
            mechanism for resolving all categories of disputes—particularly
            commercial, contractual and institutional matters that lend
            themselves to structured resolution. Section 89 as a Judicial Policy
            Tool Section 89 CPC reflects a policy choice by the legislature to
            institutionalise dispute resolution beyond traditional adjudication.
            Judicial pronouncements have reinforced that this provision is
            intended to reduce procedural burden, promote efficiency and enable
            courts to focus their resources on matters requiring authoritative
            determination. Importantly, courts have clarified that referrals
            under Section 89 are not a dilution of judicial authority. On the
            contrary, they represent judicial supervision over an expanded
            dispute resolution framework, where outcomes—whether arbitral awards
            or mediated settlements—remain subject to legal recognition and
            enforcement. Judicial Emphasis on Institutional Frameworks Recent
            judicial trends demonstrate a clear preference for institutional ADR
            mechanisms over ad-hoc processes. Courts have highlighted concerns
            surrounding unilateral appointments, procedural inconsistency and
            lack of transparency in unstructured dispute resolution. In
            response, judicial discourse has increasingly favoured neutral,
            rules-based institutions that provide: • transparent appointment
            mechanisms, • procedural discipline and • administrative oversight
            without interference in adjudication. This approach aligns with the
            broader objective of Section 89—to ensure that disputes are resolved
            efficiently while maintaining confidence in legal outcomes.
            Arbitration as a Complement to Adjudication Judicial reasoning has
            consistently underscored that arbitration does not replace the
            courts. Instead, it operates in coordination with them. Courts
            retain a supervisory role at critical stages, including referral,
            interim protection and enforcement, ensuring that arbitral
            proceedings remain anchored in legality and fairness. By encouraging
            structured arbitration under institutional frameworks, courts have
            sought to strike a balance between party-driven resolution and
            judicial oversight—an equilibrium that strengthens the overall
            dispute resolution ecosystem. Evolving Judicial Outlook The
            trajectory of judicial interpretation reveals a clear trend:
            alternative dispute resolution is no longer viewed as an optional
            adjunct, but as a necessary partner to litigation. Section 89 CPC
            continues to serve as a statutory bridge between courts and
            structured dispute resolution mechanisms, enabling timely and
            enforceable outcomes while preserving procedural integrity. As
            judicial caseloads grow and commercial disputes become increasingly
            complex, the role of institutional arbitration and mediation is
            likely to expand further—guided by judicial principles of fairness,
            neutrality and efficiency. ⸻ Disclaimer This article is intended
